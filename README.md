News Game Proposal 

The idea of the game is to collect the "coins". So the sprite represents the US border control and the coins represent the illegal "coins". The idea of the game is to round them up, then you win.

The politcal issue that is brought up by this is that should the US border patrol take away "coins" that try to get across the border. 

I reserched this topic and found that there was a new study that saif that the number of illegal "coins" that try to jump the border has decreased to 170,000 per year. (2015) This is one tenth what it was in 2005. So, that makes this game revalvant.
