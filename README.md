News Game, Pt. 2
News Game Proposal 

For my new game project, I plan on doing something that relates to the debate for and against the construction of a wall between Mexico and the US. Iâ€™m planning on creating a game similar to brick breaker. The bricks will represent the wall. For the ball and paddle, it will represent the party who opposes the construction of a wall. Most likely a Democratic flag and logo for the ball. There will be text to represent each side, Mexico and the US. Also, images of immigrants will be on the Mexico side. The game represents that there is 2 strong sides in America about building a wall and is a modern political issue. 

The political topic in the game will revolve around the current issue of building a wall between Mexico and the US. The idea of this game is goping to very minimal and simple. There is levels and lives in the game. This represents that there is more supposrt for building the wall in America. As the levels progress, more bricks are added showing that there is more support for the wall, even if the oposing party is destroying some of the ideas. (represented by the bricks)
